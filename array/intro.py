import array as arr  #here we alias array as arr, and we need to import the array package
# we need to define which type
# only one type of elements can be added in an array
a = arr.array('d',[1.2,2.5,3.6,4.7])  # here float value hece defined as double = d
print(a)

#int type
import array as arr
a1=arr.array('i',[1,2,3,4,5]) #integer array defined as "i"
print(a1)

# array is faster than array so array is used than list
# same operations as that of list

# acessing using index values
# update
# slice
# congagnation
# remove
# delete

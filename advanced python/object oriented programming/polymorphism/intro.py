#polymorphism...many forms

# overloading(in inheritance)= when method name is same for parent class and child class,the different in the arguments
                             # or the parameters is considered and the concerned method will be considered

#over-riding(inheritance)- same method name,same parameters, here only child class method only will be called and
                         # block the parent method

#polymorphism comes in methods

# overloading not supported in python - here latest method created will be considered
# over riding method is supported
